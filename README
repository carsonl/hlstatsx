A merging of the following repositories:
* https://github.com/samdisk11/HLStatsX-CE2
* https://github.com/brysondev/hlstatsx-revamped

There are still some things broken:
* Admin page doesn't work, refer to `Docker/SQL-hacks.txt` for some manual bits to do
* Links to player pages are not always present when they should be (The awards page seems to be the best way to find them)
* Fully qualified links sometimes send you to the wrong place, depending on how you setup the end-point URL for accessing the site
* Probably many more


Under `Docker/` there is a Dockerfile, configuration files, and scripts to get things running
Under `Docker/maintenance/` there are some more helpful scripts to maintain the setup
  I set all of this workflow up well before I knew about docker-compose/Swarm, and wanted more control
  I just haven't really bothered using anything else, as it fit my needs

The variety of scripts here are usually self-evident on how to run them, sometimes they'll need the "instance" name as the first parameter... I should document this properly one day.
The scripts also support a variety of hacky features used by some containers, some of which are not these.
The Dockerfile assumes an apt-cacher setup running on the host, remove the lines as appropriate.
The scripts also assume `gadjet` as the docker registry user, that is me, probably change it, but in theory as it is all handled outside of a registry, it shouldn't actually cause any harm.
You will need your own mariadb server to use
Create an `env.list` file under `Docker/` containing the DB details:
```
DB_ADDR=172.17.0.1 #  Probably
DB_NAME=hlstatsx #  Probably
DB_USER=<username>
DB_PASS=<password>
```

In theory (mostly un-tested), you should be able to:
(These are used by my broader Docker setup that symlink to generic scripts under /var/scripts/docker/scripts/default/, except when {build,check}-extra.sh are actually required)
  ./build-extra.sh	Perform extra build steps if required
  ./build.sh		To build the docker image
  ./check-extra.sh	Perform extra check steps if required
  ./check.sh		Check whether the containers are running
  ./debug.sh		Enter one of the containers for debugging
  ./kill.sh		As expected (forceful)
  ./logs.sh		Tail logs
  ./print-*.sh		Print out the launch parameters for a container, used by run/etc.
  ./rebuild.sh		Kill existing containers, remove old image(s) and build a new one
  ./restart.sh		As expected
  ./rm.sh		Stop, kill, then delete existing containers
  ./run.sh		To build the run the containers (4 of them, based on the `print*` files)
  ./stop.sh		As expected (graceful)

In theory (mostly un-tested), you should be able to:
(Probably required to live under /var/scripts/docker/scripts/maintenance - These are used by my broader Docker setup)
  maintenance/build-all.sh	Build all the containers
  maintenance/check-all.sh	Check all the containers (and restart)
  maintenance/clean-all.sh	Clean up a bunch of stuff
  maintenance/restart-all.sh	Restart everything
  maintenance/stop-all.sh	Stop everything

Cronjob to check things are running:
`* * * * * root   timeout 2m flock -n /var/scripts/docker/scripts/maintenance/check-all.sh -c '/var/scripts/docker/scripts/maintenance/check-all.sh 2>&1`
